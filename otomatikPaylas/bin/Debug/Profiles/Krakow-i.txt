Our next time seems like heading us to you :P 



We are two guys from different earth having really different perspective of life, being happy with a small things but big
entrepreneurs. We just need your place to crush for 2 nights and make our stay unforgettable with you there. Let me introduce
us. Me Ozzy and him Bil. Internationals call us like that so we got used to being called :) 

We are 2 traveler who live in Krakow now. We are hosting many people here, due home renovation we need to be hosted by someone(life is funny). We taught it would be nice to use CS to meet with other hosts in Krakow. 

Beside we are working on a project, Do you wanna be part of it? because we want/need you. Basically, NothingGoesWrong (NGS) project is about 
making friends from all over the world and ask them to share their culture with us. If you are keen on being on the record then here you are. We have 
hundreds of people so far and we need many more than that. I hope you have time to spend on us and share your perspective. We'd be more than happy.
Thanks in advance!
